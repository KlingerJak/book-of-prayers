# Book of Prayers

This Book of Prayers is a collection of prayers from various traditions throughout the world.  

There are three purposes for creating this collection.

1) To make it easy for people to find the prayers from their own tradition.

2) To make it easy for people to be aware of the prayers in traditions which are not their own.

3) To make a collection of prayers that can be easily integrated into any online libraries / scripture readers using the Cumorah "engine" to publish their library.
