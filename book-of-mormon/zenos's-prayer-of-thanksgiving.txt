. Thou art merciful O Elohim, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; 

. Yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those which were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me; 

. Yea, O YHVH, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.

. And again, O Elohim, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer, and when I did turn unto my closet, O YHVH, and prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me; 

. Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children, when they cry unto thee to be heard of thee, and not of men; and thou wilt hear them; 

. Yea, O Elohim, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations; 

. Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out, and have been despised by mine enemies; 

. Yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger, with speedy destruction; 

. And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me; 

. Therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions; for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.
