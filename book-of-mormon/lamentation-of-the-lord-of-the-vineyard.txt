. It grieveth me that I should lose them.

. But what could I have done more in my vineyard? 

. Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost all the day long. 

. And the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire, that they should be burned.

. Who is it that hath corrupted my vineyard?
